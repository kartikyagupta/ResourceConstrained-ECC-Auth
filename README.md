## Description

This project aims to develop privacy-preserving authentication schemes for resource-constrained devices using ECC. The primary focus will be on designing zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) protocols that allow devices to prove their identity without revealing sensitive information. You can achieve this by exploring various ZKP constructions, such as Schnorr signatures and zk-SNARKs, and adapting them to the specific requirements of elliptic curve cryptography. Additionally, you can investigate the use of threshold cryptography and secure multi-party computation techniques to enable secure and privacy-preserving authentication in distributed systems with resource-constrained devices.

## Features
